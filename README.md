# TIPE car-detector

30% of the traffic in the city today is made up of motorists looking for parking spaces.\
To answer this problem, I am studying the viability of a sensor that would be placed on the parking spaces of a city and that would allow, with the help of an application, to easily find the unoccupied parking spaces near you.

For the moment, the sensor is made of a raspberry pi, coupled with an ultrasound sensor.\
In the future, I would like to study an induction sensor to detect only metal, even under a layer of dust.

You will find below the schematic of the assembly.\
